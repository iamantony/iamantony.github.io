About a year ago I worked on my home-project that was related to image compression.
I used my favorite framework - Qt - and things were going well.

Until one day I didn't need to plot some statistcs data. If I were used Python, I would
just import [matplotlib][1] library, add several lines of code and - whoop - 
get neat diagrams! But I used C++ and Qt. And I didn't want to make this task too complicated. 
So I decided that the simpliest way for me was to export my data to [csv-file][2], 
open it with Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc and create plots. Ok, let's do it!

CSV-file have simple structure. It is a text file, each line of it is a single row. Elements
in the each row are separated with separator (comma or tab or any other separator).
