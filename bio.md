Antony Cherepanov: human, developer.

Most of my live I lived in Pervouralsk (Russia). Here I went to the kindergarden 
and school. In 2007 I went to the Ural Federal University and moved to the Yekaterinburg. 
In 2014 my girlfriend said to me that enough is enough - 
it's too cold for her on Ural - so we moved to warmer Moscow.

I get interested in programming at school. We learned fundamentals of 
Computer Science  and implemented some simple algorithms on BASIC.

On the first year at the University I started to learn C. At first it was not 
easy: includes, stack, heap, arrays, pointers, memory leaking... But after some 
practice I got used to "strange rules" of C. Unfortunately, in the following 
years at the University we concentrated more on radioelectronics and 
by the fourth year I forgot most of my programming skills. After I received 
a bachelor's degree and enrolled in the master's degree, I again took up 
the study of programming.

By the time I got to my first job. It was related with electronics. I thought 
that it would be great place to use my knowledge that I acquired 
at the University. I was wrong. Job was boring and not interesting. 
So after six months I quit it and decided to become a programmer. 

I found a new job and started to work as a junior developer. It was whole 
new world for me! I spent much time to learn bunch of new stuff: C++, 
Qt framework, Linux basics, programming techniques and so on.

Since that I changed several jobs. Worked as Game Developer (it was fun!), 
frontend/backend developer (unfortunately not too long). I started to 
learn Python (love it!), Java, Android and became interested in image processing.

Every day I try to learn something new: C++ in depth, SQL, TDD, program architecture, system 
administration... It's not always easy, but always fun.
