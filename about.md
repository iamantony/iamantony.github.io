<p>
I'm a developer and aspirant at the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://urfu.ru/en/">Ural Federal University</a>
</p>

<p>
Most of my live I lived in Pervouralsk, then I went to the University and moved 
to the Yekaterinburg. In 2014 my girlfriend said to my that enough is enough - 
it's too cold for her on Ural, so we moved to warmer Moscow.
</p>

<p>
I get interested in programming at school. We learned fundamentals of 
Computer Science (binary arithmetic and so on) and implemented some simple 
algorithms on BASIC.
</p>

<p>
In the first year at the University I started to learn C. At first it was not 
easy: includes, stack, heap, arrays, pointers, memory leaking... But after some 
practice I got used to "strange rules" of C. Unfortunately, in the following 
years at the University we concentrated more on radioelectronics and 
by the fourth year I forgot most of my programming skills. After I received 
a bachelor's degree and enrolled in the master's degree, I again took up 
the study of programming.
</p>

<p>
By the time I got to my first job. It was related with electronics. I thought 
that it would be great place to use my knowledge that I acquired 
at the University. I was wrong. Job was boring and not interesting. 
So after six months I quit it and decided to become a programmer. 
</p>

<p>
I found a new job and started to work as junior developer. It was whole 
new world for me! I spent much time to learn bunch of new stuff: C++, 
Qt framework, UNIX basics, programming techniques and so on.
</p>

<p>
Since that I changed several jobs. Worked as Game Developer (it was fun!), 
frontend/backend developer (unfortunately not too long and still have weak 
knowledge of web development). I started to learn Python (love it!) and became 
interested in image processing.
</p>

<p>
I still can't say that I became a professional programmer. Every day I try 
to learn something new: C++ in depth, SQL, TDD, program architecture, system 
administration... It's not always easy, but always fun.
</p>

<p>
Well, that's it. Thanks for reading my blog!

P.S.: I'm not good at English so if you will see any mistakes it would be 
great if you would help me to correct them!
