# Learning how to learn: Sumup

## Focused and Diffuse modes

Our brain could work in two modes: focused and diffuse.

### Focused mode (FM)

- in FM you could concentrate on solving problems that are in some sense are familiar to you. It means that you already have an experience in solving such problems and in your brain there is an established solid connection between synapses...
- to enter in FM you need to remove all distraction (email, loud sound, other people) and concentrate on a problem

### Diffuse mode (DM)

- in DM mode you can look at things broadly from a very different, big-picture perspective. You can make new neural connections traveling along new pathways.
- in DM mode your brain is able to find a solution for a problem that you did not solve before, understand and create new ideas

You can not work in FM and DM at the same time.

If you stuck on a tough problem (it may relate not only to science), the best way to solve it is:
- at first use focused mode. Try to concentrate on it and do your best. It is not so important to actually solve it. Your goal is to "load" context of the problem into your brain.
- after that enter in diffuse mode. Try to relax your mind. You could watch silly show, take a bath, do some exercises and so on. Your subconscious should start to work on the problem
