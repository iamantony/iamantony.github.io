I believe I'm pragmatic person. I always have a plan for my life in some part
of my brain (well, maybe not always, but definitely most of the time). Sometimes
I can "see" my plan - I mean it's well structured, neat plan and I know what to
do at each step. Sometimes I can only "feel" it. I feel, that I exactly have a
plan. And it is potentially good, but its outlines are vague.

Do I follow my plan? Most of the time - yes. I know that I must do "this and
that" to get to my goal and not be angry at yourself. But there are so many
things to do, to learn... and sometimes it is very difficult to place
priorities rightly.

In our modern IT world there are so many temptations: languages, new paradigms
and technologies. "Hey! See this new super-duper programming 
language/library/technology! You definitely should try it!" - that is what I 
hear in my head time to time when read some IT resource in the Internet. 
Sometimes it is reasonable to change your plans and do something else. Maybe 
this new thingy will really help you. Some day. Or not. And you always should
remember about time and deadlines.

Ok, so what this all about? This year I decided to make up my first Plan For
The Year. Here it is:

  * Finish my diploma project  
  * Read at least 2 books about C++  
  * Finish at least 1 on-line course
  
They are my main goals for the year and I must to finish all these tasks till
the end of the 2015. The first one is the hardest, because I don't know how
much time I will need to do all the research for my diploma. But I will try.
And I hope for the better.
