Well, some days ago I decided to start a blog on GitHub. So here I am.

What I will post here? Information about my projects, some tips and tricks that
I found in different fields of IT (programming languages, operation systems,
algorithms, ...), solutions for problems that I encountered and may be
something else. Anyway, it will be interesting for me. Hope for you too.
